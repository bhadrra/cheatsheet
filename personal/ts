 ping 10.0.0.1 | ts

 The -s option will show incremental timestamps from the start of the program or action. 
 In other words it will show the time since you started the program
 ping 10.0.0.1 | ts -s

 The -i options works a little differently. It shows the time since the last timestamp.
 ping 10.0.0.1 | ts -i
