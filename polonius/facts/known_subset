These reflect the `'a: 'b` relations that are either declared by the user on function
declarations or which are inferred via implied bounds.
For example: `fn foo<'a, 'b: 'a, 'c>(x: &'c &'a u32)` would have two entries:
- one for the user-supplied subset `'b: 'a`
- and one for the `'a: 'c` implied bound from the `x` parameter,
(note that the transitive relation `'b: 'c` is not necessarily included
explicitly, but rather inferred by polonius).
