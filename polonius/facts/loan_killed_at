Borrow checking
(T::Loan, T::Point)

`loan_killed_at(loan, point)` when some prefix of the path borrowed at `loan`
is assigned at `point`.
Indicates that the path borrowed by the `loan` has changed in some way that the loan no
longer needs to be tracked. (In particular, mutations to the path that was borrowed
no longer invalidate the loan)
