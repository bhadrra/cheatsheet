Borrow checking

T::Origin, T::Loan, T::Point

`loan_issued_at(origin, loan, point)` indicates that the `loan` was "issued"
at the given `point`, creating a reference with the `origin`.
Effectively, `origin` may refer to data from `loan` starting at `point` (this is usually
the point *after* a borrow rvalue).
