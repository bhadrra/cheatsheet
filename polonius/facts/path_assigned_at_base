Facts
InitializationContext
T::Path, T::Point

`path_assigned_at(path, point)` when the `path` was initialized at point
`point`. This fact is only emitted for a prefix `path`, and not for the
implicit initialization of all of `path`'s children. E.g. a statement like
`x.y = 3` at `point` would give the fact `initialized_at(x.y, point)` (but
neither `initialized_at(x.y.z, point)` nor `initialized_at(x, point)`).
